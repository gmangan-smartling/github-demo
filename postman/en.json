      "<p>The most farsighted companies take an API-first approach to their software development. Before writing a single line of code, developers, in partnership with the business, first design or build the API. This ensures the underlying app can seamlessly connect with internal and external applications. Doing so expands the app's capabilities and makes it accessible to partners and end-users.</p>",
      "<p>Being API-first means prioritizing the APIs that support your application and focusing on the value they can deliver to your business, rather than just scrambling to deliver a single application and creating an API as an afterthought. This forward-thinking approach allows the application to be adopted by different parts of the business for multiple uses, through the API.</p>",
      "<p>APIs are not one-and-done projects. APIs are key building blocks that need to be maintained and improved. Companies are recognizing this and building teams to support it.</p>"

These APIs have helped millions of small businesses grow and created powerful tech platforms worth hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>",
      "<p>But it is private, or internal APIs, where software developers devote most of their efforts. In fact, 58 percent of the APIs that developers work with are for internal use only, according to Postman's 2022 <a href='/state-of-api/'>State of the API report</a>, which surveyed over 37,000 API professionals.</p>",
      "<p>Private APIs allow different applications, many of them stored in the cloud, to share data and services, and deliver actionable insights. Much of this can be done automatically, providing visibility across the organization for employees of every rank.</p>",
      "<p>Once built, <a href='https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/adding-private-network/'>private APIs</a> can be reused throughout the business, offering faster delivery and saving valuable developer resources.</p>",
      "<p>As the needs of the organization expand and require interacting with business partners, partner APIs come into play. Partner APIs allow organizations to share their APIs with just select users and customers, offering opportunities to collaborate, create business partnerships, and gather targeted feedback. Partner APIs constitute 27% of organizations' APIs, according to the State of the API report.</p>",
      "<p>Public APIs, APIs that are openly available on the web to all, account for about 15 percent of organizations' APIs, according to the State of the API report.</p>",
      "<p>Altogether, how much effort are organizations devoting to APIs? Some 51% of developers say that more than half of their organizations' development effort is spent on APIs.</p>"
